### Data Exploration and Cleaning
1. **Loading and Inspecting Data:**
   - Dataset: `Car_Insurance_Claim.csv`
   - Columns: 19
   - Shape: 10,000 rows Ã— 19 columns

2. **Data Types and Missing Values:**
   - Identified missing values in `Credit_Score` and `Annual_Mileage`, which were imputed with mean values.
   - Handled outliers in `Credit_Score` by removing extreme values.

3. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Provided summary statistics for numeric columns.
   - Analyzed distribution and correlations.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - **Pairplots and Histograms:** To understand the distribution of data and correlation with the outcome.
   - **Bar Plots and Count Plots:** For categorical variables (e.g., Age, Gender, Race) to visualize the impact on the outcome.
   - **Correlation Matrix:** Showed the relationship between attributes and the outcome.
   - **Outlier Detection:** Identified and removed outliers from the `Credit_Score` column.

### Feature Engineering and Model Building
1. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Converted categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding.
   - Scaled the features using `StandardScaler`.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - **Models Tested:** Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve.
   - **Cross-Validation:** Evaluated models with 5-fold cross-validation to get accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

### Key Insights
- **Age and Outcome:** Younger age groups (16-25) have higher claim rates compared to older groups.
- **Gender and Outcome:** Males tend to have more claims than females.
- **Vehicle Type:** Sedan cars have higher claims than sports cars.
- **Income:** Higher income groups tend to have more speeding violations.
- **Postal Code:** Certain postal codes, like 10238, have higher claim rates.

### Model Performance
- **Logistic Regression:**
  - Accuracy: ~84.56%
  - Precision: ~77.14%
  - Recall: ~71.77%
  - F1 Score: ~74.35%

- **K-Nearest Neighbors:**
  - Accuracy: ~81.06%
  - Precision: ~71.63%
  - Recall: ~65.08%
  - F1 Score: ~68.19%

### Next Steps
1. **Model Tuning:** Consider hyperparameter tuning for the models.
2. **Feature Selection:** Explore feature importance to reduce dimensionality.
3. **Model Deployment:** Evaluate how well the models perform on unseen data or in a real-world setting.
